This project retrieves and visualizes a 5-day weather forecast for a specific city (e.g., Mumbai) using the OpenWeatherMap API. It fetches temperature data at regular intervals, processes it, and presents the temperature trends over time in a clear line chart using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The tool provides an intuitive graphical overview of upcoming temperature changes, helping users better understand weather patterns.
